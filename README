ICAP Analyzer for Bro and Zeek

==================
Introduction
==================
Internet Content Adaptation Protocol (ICAP) Analyzer for the Bro and Zeek 
Network Security Monitor.

The ICAP Analyzer was developed on a Bro v2.4.1 platform with BinPAC 
v0.44, using the BinPAC Quick Start guide, and compiled directly into
the Bro core.  Recommended for use with Bro v2.4.1 or later.

The ICAP Analyzer Plugin was developed on a Bro v2.5-draft platform.
The Plugin is NOT recommended for Bro v2.4.1 or earlier.  Requires
Bro v2.5 or later.

For more information about the ICAP analyzer, see the BroCon'16 abstract 
and presentation slides posted on the Bro website, at the following URL:
  - https://www.bro.org/community/brocon2016.html

For more information about the ICAP protocol itself, see RFC 3507, dated 
April 2003, along with the additional references listed below:

==============================
Installation - 
Plugin via Package Manager *
==============================

To install the ICAP Analyzer as a Plugin, use the Bro Package Manager to
install the ICAP Analyzer Plugin on Bro v2.5 or later.

For more information on how to install Bro Packages, see the following
reference:
  - https://github.com/bro/package-manager


  * NOTE 1: Requires Bro v2.5 or later.
    NOTE 2: On Bro v2.4.1, the Plugin encounters a discrepancy within
    Bro's built-in regular-expression pattern-matching functionality,
    and the ICAP packets parse incorrectly.  This behavior is observed
    on v2.4.1 only when the ICAP Analyzer is implemented as a Plugin.
    This behavior is not observed on v2.4.1 when the ICAP Analyzer is
    compiled directly into the Bro core.  This issue appears to be
    fixed on v2.5-beta.


==============================
Installation - 
Plugin via Manual Method *
==============================

To install the ICAP Analyzer as a Plugin manually, see the Bro Plugin
documentation at the following URL:
  - https://www.bro.org/sphinx/devel/plugins.html

==============================
Installation - 
Compile into Bro Core
==============================

To compile the ICAP Analyzer directly into the Bro core, follow Steps 1 
thru 8 below.  Recommended for use with Bro v2.4.1 or later.

The expression <bro_distro> denotes the path of the Bro distribution, 
such as /opt/bro-2.4.1.

The expression <bro_install> denotes the installation path after running
'make install' on the source code, such as /usr/local/bro.


--------------
Step 1 - Root.
--------------
1.1 Change to the root account.

1.2 Proceed to Step 2.


------------------------------------------------
Step 2 - Copy Source Files into Bro Source Tree.
------------------------------------------------
2.1 Create ICAP directories in the Bro source tree:
    mkdir <bro_distro>/src/analyzer/protocol/icap
    mkdir <bro_distro>/scripts/base/protocols/icap

2.2 Copy the following ICAP files into the Bro src directory <bro_distro>/src/analyzer/protocol/icap:
    ./CHANGES
    ./COPYING
    ./README
    ./VERSION
    ./src/CMakeLists.txt*
    ./src/ICAP.cc
    ./src/ICAP.h
    ./src/Plugin.cc
    ./src/events.bif
    ./src/icap.pac
    ./src/icap-analyzer.pac
    ./src/icap-analyzer-http.pac
    ./src/icap-analyzer-utils.pac
    ./src/icap-protocol.pac

  * NOTE: This file './src/CMakeLists.txt' is used for compiling the
    ICAP Analyzer into the Bro Core.  The other file './CMakeLists.txt'
    is used for building is as a Plugin.
 
2.3 Copy the following ICAP files into the Bro scripts directory <bro_distro>/scripts/base/protocols/icap:
    ./scripts/__load__.bro
    ./scripts/dpd.bro
    ./scripts/main.bro

2.4 Proceed to Step 3.


-----------------------------
Step 3 - Edit Bro Build List.
-----------------------------
3.1 Edit the Bro file <bro_distro>src/analyzer/protocol/CMakelists.txt*
    to add the following statement (in alphabetical order, between http
    and icmp):
    add_subdirectory(icap)

  * NOTE: This is NOT the same file copied onto Bro in Step 2.2.
    This file has the same name, but it is already on the system, 
    one directory up.

3.2 Save changes.

3.3 Proceed to Step 4.


-------------------------------
Step 4 - Edit Bro Startup List.
-------------------------------
4.1 Edit the Bro file <bro_distro>/scripts/base/init-default.bro 
    to add the following statement (in alphabetical order, between http
    and irc):
    @load base/protocols/icap

4.2 Save changes.

4.3 Proceed to Step 5.


------------------------------------------------
Step 5 - Add Custom Scripts to Bro Startup List.
------------------------------------------------
5.1 [Optional] Edit the Bro file <bro_install>/share/bro/site/local.bro
    to load any custom Bro scripts related to ICAP analysis.

5.2 [Optional] Save changes.

5.3 Proceed to Step 6.


---------------------
Step 6 - Re-Make Bro.
---------------------
6.1 If Bro is already running, stop Bro, via the following command:
    <bro_install>/bin/broctl stop

6.2 Configure, make & install Bro:
    cd <bro_distro>
    ./configure  (NOTE: include any flags/options, if applicable)
    make
    make install

6.3 [Optional] If using PF_RING, confirm Bro is linked with PF_RING 
    libpcap:
    ldd <bro_install>/bin/bro | grep pcap

6.4 Proceed to Step 7.


-------------------------------------
Step 7 - Re-Start Bro via BroControl.
-------------------------------------
7.1 Start Bro:
    <bro_install>/bin/broctl deploy

7.2 Confirm Bro is running:
    <bro_install>/bin/broctl status

7.3 Confirm ICAP Analyzer is active:
    <bro_install>/bin/bro -N | grep ICAP

7.4 Proceed to Step 8.


--------------
Step 8 - Done.
--------------
8.1  Installation complete.  No further action required.
